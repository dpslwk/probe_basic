Select the Linux Debian 12 Bookworm Netinst CD ISO from the above link. you will need to make a bootable dvd or USB thumb drive depending on how you plan to install.  The below software is extremely easy and works flawlessly with linux debian OS images. Below is the link for it. I recommend using 2-4gb USB drive for quicker flashing.

Once you have created your flash stick for linuxcnc proceed to install and boot the system. (note: It is advised to have an ethernet cable internet connection during install).  Select the graphical installation option. Follow the steps on screen to complete installation.  When you are greeted by the Linux Desktop Selection Page, uncheck the GNOME option and check the XFCE4 option.

After installation, copy the following in the main terminal one line at a time and hit enter, select Y for yes if asked at any point during installation.  If the return shows "All up to Date" then you can proceed to the next step.

::

    sudo apt update

    sudo apt upgrade



**If you have not already installed linuxcnc from apt, use the following line in main terminal:**

::

    sudo apt install linuxcnc-uspace linuxcnc-uspace-dev mesaflash



**Once you have installed linuxcnc, open linuxcnc and start the axis sim briefly and then you can shut it down to ensure the installation was succesful.**


**Adding the apt repository to Debian 12, Run the following Lines in Main terminal one at a time**

::

    sudo apt install curl


    echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://repository.qtpyvcp.com/apt develop main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kcjengr.list

::

    sudo apt install python3-qtpyvcp

    sudo apt install python3-probe-basic

**Updating of probe basic and qtpyvcp will occur when your run the normal "sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade" commands.  During updating, the probe basic sim configuration files will be overwritten.  It is strongly recommended to create your machine configuration files with unique names to avoid having them overwritten during updates.**
